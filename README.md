##### About PapaBearDoes
I run a *501(c)(3)* dog rescue out of my house, so any and all donations to me are tax deductible. The rescue name is **K9 Trust**.

I am a founding member of [The Alphabet Cartel](https://discord.alphabetcartel.org), and we play on the ***\[US\]\[H\]Hellscream*** server under the guild ***&lt;Alphabet Cartel&gt;*** (we are looking for more players to join!).  We are a conglomeration of gamers and content creators that have banded together to provide a safe place for LGBTQIA+ members and allies, and to provide awareness and education on the issues that the Cartel experiences through games, discussion, and community.

You can join the Cartel via our [discord server](https://discord.alphabetcartel.org) (or in game, any member online can invite).
