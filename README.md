***Roman***
# Message Barker for WoW
This was built specifically to bark our guild recruitment message.

## Retired Service Dog who still alerts
Roman is a Belgian Malinois / Husky service dog who washed due to being attacked by other people's dogs too many times, and as such no longer is allowed public access for being dog reactive now. However, he doesn't know he's no longer a service dog, so he still alerts, and one of those is to let his people know when someone is at the door by coming to you and giving one single loud bark (which for him sounds scary) just in case owner did not hear the doorbell.

Thusly, since this addon is essentially a message barker, it has been named Roman in honor of him.

Currently this only does guild recruitment barks.

### Options
This addon will share it's location and last time a bark was sent in the zone it is in so that if multiple people in the same guild are running the addon, it does not bark over another person's bark. It will also share it's settings with each other with whomever has the highest guild rank being the "Handler" for the rest of the pack.
