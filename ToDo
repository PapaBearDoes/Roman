This addon will eventually share it's location and last time a bark was sent in
the zone it is in so that if multiple people in the same guild are running the
addon, it does not bark over another person's bark.

It will also eventually share it's settings with each other, with whomever has
the highest guild rank being the "Handler" for the rest of the pack.
